<h2>Description</h2>
As part of the ISACA 2025 Cybersecurity Case Study competition, my team and I developed a comprehensive three-year cybersecurity strategy for CyberArk, a leader in Privileged Access Management. Our deliverables included defining clear KPIs to measure success, establishing a reporting cadence to leadership, evaluating CyberArk’s compliance status with cybersecurity regulations, and designing a governance framework. We also conducted a vendor risk assessment and proposed strategic partnerships to strengthen cybersecurity capabilities. Our final presentation was delivered in the form of a 15-minute YouTube video to simulate a real-world CEO-level briefing.
